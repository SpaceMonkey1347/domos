You need python3, pip jq to run the setup script:

See: [Installing Python 3 on Linux](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/linux/)

After that run:

```
sudo apt install jq
```

To install, make sure you're in the app directory before you run ./setup.bash

```bash
cd app/
./setup.bash
```
